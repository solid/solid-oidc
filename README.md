This repository hosts the Editor's draft of the Solid-OIDC specification.

This specification has been incubated by the
[Solid Authentication Panel](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel) for inclusion in the
[Solid Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/).

Anyone is welcome to join the [weekly meetings](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel#meetings).

The Solid Authentication Panel meetings and associated communication channels are open to all
to participate. It is expected that everyone will abide by the
[Solid Code of Conduct](https://github.com/solid/process/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)
in all of these interactions.
